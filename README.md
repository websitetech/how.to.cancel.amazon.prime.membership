Looking to cancel your Amazon Prime Membership or some subscriptions? Despite the many benefits, like free 2-day shipping and Amazon Prime Video, there are a quite a few reasons why you may be wanting to put an end to your affiliation with Amazon. Whether you're trying to save money or just cancel your free trial after Prime Day, we've got you covered with step-by-step instructions.

## On Desktop

1. Log In To Your Account
2. Find Prime Membership
3. End The Membership
4. End The Benefits
5. Move On To Cancel


## On Mobile

1. Locate Account
2. Find Manage Prime Membership
3. Log In To Your Account
4. Find Manage Membership
5. If you don’t want the benefits, scroll down and tap I Do Not Want My Benefits. Similar to the desktop version, Amazon prompts you to keep the benefits until the membership renews. If you don’t wish to do so, click on Continue to Cancel.
6. After you click on Continue to Cancel, you’ll go to a confirmation page where it’ll ask for the last time if you want to close the membership or need to be reminded three days before the membership automatically renews.
7. Scroll down and tap Cancel Membership. You will have two options here — terminate on a date or close it immediately. Ending on the date terminates your membership when the billing cycle is over. Click on End Now if you wish to close the subscription immediately. This cancels the membership there and then and prompts Amazon to refund the rest of the current billing cycle’s payment to you.
